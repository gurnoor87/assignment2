    "Rules to be followed while declaring a Variable name are as:\n",
    " 1.   A Variable’s name cannot start with a number. Either an alphabet or the underscore character should be used as the first character.\n",
    " 2.   Variable names are case-sensitive and can include alphanumeric letters as well as the underscore character.\n",
    " 3.    Variable names cannot contain reserved terms.\n",
    " 4.The equal to sign ‘=’, followed by the variable’s value, is used to assign variables in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple declaration and assigning of a value to the Variable\n",
    "In this type, the data values are directly assigned to the Variables in the declaration statement.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "num = 5\n",
    "l = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "str = 'My name is Gurnoor singh'\n",
